# 📸 How to Add Your Professional Photo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your professional headshot photo** from the screenshots you showed me
2. **Rename it to:** `sakshi-profile.jpg`
3. **Place it in this folder:** `C:\mp-omr-athena-application-engineering\MyPortfolio\public\`

## Full Path:
```
C:\mp-omr-athena-application-engineering\MyPortfolio\public\sakshi-profile.jpg
```

- **Size:** Recommended 500x500 to 800x800 pixels
